# Work Day Scheduler

## Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature 
dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

### Purpose

The schedule/planner should display the current date/time. The hours are from 9am-5pm. When a user types something inside the corresponding box and click the button next
to it, then it should save and still be there when refreshing the page.
